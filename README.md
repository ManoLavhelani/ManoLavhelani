## 👤 A. Personal Introduction
---
I am a BSc Computer Science Honours student at the University of the Western Cape, having completed my undergraduate degree in 2025.
I am an aspiring software developer with strong foundations in Java, Python, and C, eager to apply my technical skills to real-world systems and impactful projects. I am motivated by continuous learning, research-driven problem solving, and collaborative teamwork.
With experience in academic tutoring (including MAT212 & MAM115) and leadership roles within university societies, I have developed strong communication, organisational, and analytical skills.
I am particularly passionate about software design, Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, robotics, and emerging technologies, and I aim to contribute innovative ideas and dedication within dynamic and forward-thinking environments.
My career goal is to build innovative, secure, and scalable software systems that combine intelligent technologies with practical real-world impact.
