## 👤 A. Personal Introduction

I am a BSc Computer Science Honours student at the University of the Western Cape, having completed my undergraduate degree in 2025.

I am an aspiring software developer with strong foundations in Java, Python, and C, eager to apply my technical skills to real-world systems and impactful projects. I am motivated by continuous learning, research-driven problem solving, and collaborative teamwork.

With experience in academic tutoring (including MAT212 & MAM115) and leadership roles within university societies, I have developed strong communication, organisational, and analytical skills.

I am particularly passionate about software design, Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, robotics, and emerging technologies.

My career goal is to build innovative, secure, and scalable software systems that combine intelligent technologies with practical real-world impact.
